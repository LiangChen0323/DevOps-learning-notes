## **Terraform**

### Modules

A module is a container for multiple resources that are used together.
Every Terraform configuration has at least one module, known as its root module, which consists of the resources defined in the .tf files in the main working directory.
A module can call other modules, which lets you include the child module's resources into the configuration in a concise way. Modules can also be called multiple times, either within the same configuration or in separate configurations, allowing resource configurations to be packaged and re-used.

Modules are reusable Terraform configurations that can be called and configured by other configurations. Most modules manage a few closely related resources from a single provider. The Terraform Registry makes it easy to use any provider or module.

### Data Sources

Data sources allow data to be fetched or computed for use elsewhere in Terraform configuration. Use of data sources allows a Terraform configuration to make use of information defined outside of Terraform, or defined by another separate Terraform configuration.
