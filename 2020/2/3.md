`Headless services`  
A headless service is obtained by setting the clusterIP field to None. (--cluster-ip=None or by providing a custom YAML)  
As a result, the service doesn’t have a virtual IP address, there is not load balancer either
CoreDNS will return the pods’IP addresses as multiple A records, this gives us an easy way to discover all the replicas for a deployment

```
kubectl create -f whatever.yaml
```

• creates resources if they don't exist  
• if resources already exist, don't alter them (and display error message)

```
kubectl apply -f whatever.yaml
```

• creates resources if they don't exist  
• if resources already exist, update them (to match the definition provided by the YAML file)  
• stores the manifest as an annotation in the resource
