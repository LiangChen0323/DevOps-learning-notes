#### Registering variables

Another major use of variables is running a command and registering the result of that command as a variable. When you execute a task and save the return value in a variable for use in later tasks, you create a registered variable. There are more examples of this in the Conditionals chapter.

`stat` – Retrieve file or file system status

exp:

```
- hosts: web_servers
  tasks:
     - shell: /usr/bin/foo
       register: foo_result
       ignore_errors: True
     - shell: /usr/bin/bar
when: foo_result.rc == 5
```

exp2:

```
--- # Ansible conditional example
- hosts: remote
  vars:
    target_file: /home/ansible/hostname
  tasks:
    - name: Gather file information
      stat:
        path: "{{ target_file }}"
      register: hostname
    - name: Rename hostname when found
      command: mv "{{ target_file }}" /home/ansible/net-info
      when: hostname.stat.exists
```

hostname has the return value of `stat: path: "{{ target_file }}"`

#### Loops

Exp1:

```
- name: add several users
  user:
  name: "{{ item }}"
  state: present
  groups: "wheel"
  loop:
  - testuser1
  - testuser2
```

Can define the list in a variables file, or in the `vars` section of your play, then refer to the name of the list in the task:

exp2:
loop2.yml

```
--- # loop example
- hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  vars_files:
  - vars.yml
    tasks:
  - name: Check services
    service:
      name: "{{ item }}"
      state: started
      loop: "{{ service_list }}"
```

var.yml:

```
working_dir: /home/ansible/working

service_list:
- httpd
- nfs
- mariadb

share_paths:
nfs: /mnt/nfs
cifs: /mnt/cifs
iscsi: /mnt/iscsi
```

#### Handlers:

Running Operations On Change
Modules should be idempotent and can relay when they have made a change on the remote system. Playbooks recognize this and have a basic event system that can be used to respond to change.

These `‘notify’` actions are triggered at the end of each block of tasks in a play, and will only be triggered once even if notified by multiple different tasks.

Exp1:

```
- name: template configuration file
  template:
  src: template.j2
  dest: /etc/foo.conf
  notify: - restart memcached - restart apache
```

`Handlers` are lists of tasks, not really any different from regular tasks, that are referenced by a globally unique name, and are notified by notifiers. If nothing notifies a handler, it will not run. Regardless of how many tasks notify a handler, it will run only once, after all of the tasks complete in a particular play.
(listen should be same as notify)

Exp2:

```
tasks:
  - name: restart everything
    command: echo "this task will restart the web services"
    notify: "restart web services"

handlers:
  - name: restart memcached
    service:
      name: memcached
      state: restarted
    listen: "restart web services"
  - name: restart apache
    service:
      name: apache
      state: restarted
    listen: "restart web services"
```

exp3:

```
--- # handler example
- hosts: scoldham2
  become: yes
  vars:
    httpd_log_level: error
  tasks:
    - name: install httpd
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: latest
    - name: update configuration
      template:
        src: /home/ansible/httpd.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
        notify: httpd service
      handlers:
    - name: httpd service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted
        listen: httpd service
```
