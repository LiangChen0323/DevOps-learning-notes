## **Docker-Kubernetes**

Storage

StatefulSets is a new resource type, making Pods more sticky

Volumes

2 types volumes:  
Volumes:  
Tied to lifecycle to a Pod  
All containers in a single Pod can share them

PersistentVolumes:  
Create at the cluster level, outlives a Pod
Separates storage config from Pod using it
Multiple Pods can share them

CSI: Container Storage Interface  
CSI plugins are the new way to connect to storage

Ingress

None of Service types work at OSI Layer 7(HTTP)  
How do we route outside connections based on hostname or URL:  
Ingress Controllers(optional) do this with 3rd party proxies  
Nginx, Traefik, HAProxy, F5, Envoy, Istio…

CRD’s and The Operator Pattern

Can add 3rd party Resources and Controllers, which extends K8S API and CLI  
Operator Pattern: automate deployment and management of complex apps: Databases, monitoring tools, backups and custom ingresses…

Higher Abstractions for Apps

Deployment options  
All kubectl commands just talk to K8S API  
K8S has limited built-in templating, versioning, tracking and management of your apps  
**Helm**: create templating YAML

K8S dashboard: a web GUI for cluster management  
Some distributions have their own GUI (Rancher, Docker Ent, OpenShift)

Kubectl Namespaces and Context
Namespaces limit scope, aka “virtual clusters”
