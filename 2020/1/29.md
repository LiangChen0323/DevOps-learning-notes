## **Docker-Kubernetes**

```
Kubectl run --restart=OnFailure
```

Create a job (one time thing to do, such as batch job), don’t need restart if it has healthy exit

```
Kubectl run --restart=Never
```

Whatever happened to the pod (doesn’t create whole development) it won’t restart

```
Kubectl run --schedule=…
```

Create cronjobs (a job that will be executed at specific intervals)

```
kubectl run --schedule="_/3 _ \* \* _" --restart=OnFailure --image=alpine sleep 10
```

run alpine every 3 mins (\_/3 \* \* \* \* is same what crond in UNIX)

To create explicit things, use kubectl create

```
Kubectl create deployment
Kubectl create job
Kubectl create cronjob
```

**Kubectl run** will be used only to start one-shot pods

**Kubeclt logs** has limitation, it can only have 5 connections. (too many connections can be overwhelming to K8S API)

Use _Stern_ for showing logs of multiple pods.
