# DevOps learning notes

## **Linux(Bash)**

Command Substitution, two methods

1. static data:
   ```
   USERFILES=`find /home –user adminuser`
   Echo “All Files Owned by adminuser:\$USERFILES”
   ```
2. dynamic data:
   ```
   shopt –s expand_aliases
   alias TODAY=”date”
   D=TODAY
   Echo “With Alias, TODAY is: \$D”
   ```

`Shopt –s expand_aliases`  
expand alias in sub shall, alias only exist in sub shall -> more secure?

Exit Status  
`Echo \$?`  
(check last command’s exit status, command success returns 0, if return not 0, means failed/error)

`Set –e`  
(when a bash file occurs an error, stop the process, exit the shell, this is to prevent the wrong script overwrite important values/scripts)

Arithmetic Operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide…)  
Expr expression  
Exp:  
`Expr 2 + 2`  
(put space around “+” sign)
Use “\*” times to avoid “\*” wildcard, same happens to “()”, it should be “\( 2 + 2 \) / 4” result is 1

Global and Local Environment Variables  
`Env` and `printenv`  
(Check global environment variables)  
`Set`  
(Check Local environment variables, only specific to current login user)

## **Docker**

Overlay Multi-Host Networking

```
--driver overlay
```

For container-to-container traffic inside a single Swarm  
Exp:

```
docker network create --driver overlay mydrupal
```

(create an overlay network called mydrupal)

```
docker service create --name drupal --network mydrupal -p 80:80 drupal
docker service create --name psql --network mydrupal -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypass postgres
```

(drupal and postgres can talk to each other)

### Routing Mesh

Routes ingress(incoming) packets for a Service to proper Task, spands all nods in Swarm. It uses IPVS from Linux Kernel. Acts like a Load Balance across all tasks.  
Two ways:

1. container-to-container in an overlay network (uses VIP)
2. External traffic incoming to published ports (all nodes listen)

#### Demo commands:

#### Swarm:

```
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.0.8
```

(two nodes joined as worker nodes)

#### Networks:

```
docker network create -d overlay backend
docker network create -d overlay frontend
```

#### Services:

```
docker service create --name vote -p 80:80 --network frontend --replicas 2 bretfisher/examplevotingapp_vote
docker service create --name redis --network frontend redis:3.2
docker service create --name db --network backend --mount type=volume,source=db-data,target=/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:9.4
docker service create --name worker --network frontend --network backend bretfisher/examplevotingapp_worker:java
docker service create --name result --network backend -p 5001:80 bretfisher/examplevotingapp_result
```

### Stacks

Production grade compose  
Stacks accept Compose files as their declarative definition for services, networks and volumes
Stack manages all those objects for users, including overlay network per stack.

Docker stack deploy  
Exp:

```
Docker stack deploy –c xxxx.yml xxx
```

(Can’t do build just like in docker-compose.yml file, this is because building shouldn’t happen on production Swarm)  
On local machine Compose ignores deploy, Swarm ignores build  
Stack reads docker-compose file without needing docker-compose CLI  
Once use a configuration file to manage all the configurations, only change the conguration file.  
To update a current stack, change the configuration file(.yml), then
Docker stack deploy –c xxxx.yml xxx (same as the first time deploy stack, the system will recognise the changes in the file)

### Secrets Storage

Secure solution for storing secrets in Swarm
What is a Secret?

1. Usernames and passwords
2. TLS certificates and keys
3. SSH keys

Secret only in Swarm, but local docker-compose can use file-based secrets, but not secure (testing purpose?)  
Secrets are first stored in Swarm, then assigned to a Service(s)  
Only stored on disk on Manager nodes(encrypted) as key-value pair, can have alias  
Exp:

```
/run/secrets/<secret-name> or /run/secrets/<secret-alias>
```

Two ways to create secrets:

1. Have a .txt file with secret value, run command docker secret create xxx(secret variable) xx.txt
2. Echo “xxxx”(secret value) | docker secret create xxx(secret variable) –
   both will restore secrets locally, which is not recommended

Can also have secret files already and associated in stack(docker-compose.yml) file.
