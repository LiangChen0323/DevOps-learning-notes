Linux(Bash)
Special Characters - Quotes and Escapes
Back slash \ escapes a single character
Exp:
Echo “\$HOME” gets result-> $HOME (if no \, gets the current user home directory)
Single quote ‘’ escapes more than one character
Exp:
Echo ‘$HOME $PWD’ gets result -> $HOME \$PWD
Double quotes “” escape first character

/dev/null
anything write to /dev/null will be ignored
echo “abc” >>/dev/null
no return value

Read Statement
Read
Exp:
In a shell script
Echo “Entre your first name:”
Read FIRSTNAME
Echo “Your first name is \$FIRSTNAME”

Shell Expansion
Echo sh{ot,ort,oot} -> shot short shoot
Echo st{il,al}l -> still stall
Echo ~ -> /root (~ represents user home directory)
Echo ~+ (current working directory, same with PWD)
Echo ~- (Old PWD)
Echo “${!HO*}” (what does $ and ! mean in here?)
The ‘$’ character introduces parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic expansion.
${!prefix\*}
${!prefix@}
Expands to the names of variables whose names begin with prefix, separated by the first character of the IFS special variable. When ‘@’ is used and the expansion appears within double quotes, each variable name expands to a separate word.

Echo and sign value at one time
Echo “${FIRSTNAME:=LIANG}”
return LIANG

Types of Variables (Implicit vs. Explicit Definition)
Declare
Declare –i xxx=xxx (implicitly declare a variable as an integer)
Declare +i xxx (to unset a implicitly signed variable type, for integer)
Declare –r xxx=xxx or readyonly xxx=xxx (declare a read-only variable)

Arrays
Declare an array:
ArrayName=(value1 value2 value3 …)
No “,” between values like in programming languages
Use index to see a value
Echo ${ArrayName[0]} (echo first value, just like in all programming languages)
Echo ${ArrayName[*]} (echo all values)

Docker
App lifecycle with docker-compose
If docker-compose.override.yml and docker-compose.yml in same file, system will pick docker-compose.yml first then use docker-compose.override.yml to override docker-compose.yml file.

docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml vossibility (a single docker compose file)
docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml -c docker-compose.prod.yml vossibility (a base docker compose file + environment-specific override compose file)
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stack_deploy/

Service Updates
Docker service update –image xxapp:1.0.1 <servicename> (updates a service with an newer image)
Docker service update –en-add NODE_ENV=production –publish-rm 8080 (Adding env variable and remove a port in one command)
Docker service scale web=8 api=6 (Change number of replicas of two services)
Docker stack deploy –c xxx.yml <stackname> (Update stack using newer yml file)
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/service_update/
Docker service update –force xx (Balancing service, force service update)

Docker-Kubernetes
Swarm vs Kubernetes
Swarm: easier to deploy/manage
Kubernetes: more features and flexibility

Advantages of Swarm:

1. Comes with Docker, single vendor container platform
2. Easiest orchestrator to deploy/manage yourself
3. Follows 80/20 rule, 20% of features for 80% of use cases
4. Runs anywhere Docker does: local, Cloud, datacentre; ARM, Windows, 32bit
5. Secure by default
6. Easier to troubleshoot
   Advantages of Kubernetes:
7. Clouds will deploy/manage K8S for you
8. Infrastructure vendors are making their own distributions
9. Widest adoption and community
10. Flexible: Covers widest set of use cases
11. “K8S first” vendor support

K8S basic terms:
K8S: the whole orchestration system
Kubectl: CLI to configure K8S and manage apps
Node: Single server in the K8S cluster (Similar to Worker)
Kubelet: K8S agent running on nodes
Control Plane: Set of containers (Master, similar to Manager in Swarm) that manage the cluster, includes API server, scheduler, controller manager, etcd and more
Pod: one or more containers running together on one Node. Containers are always in pods
Controller: for creating/updating pods and other objects. Types of controllers: deployment, replicaSet, StatefulSet, DaemoSet, Job, CronJob …
Services: network endpoint to connect to pod
Namespace: Filtered group of objects in cluster

Two ways to deploy Pods(containers) in K8S: commands or YAML
Use command:
Kubectl version (Check is K8S is working, should have two versions)
Kubectl run my-nginx –image nginx (run a pod of the nginx web server)
Kubectl get pods (list the pods)
Kubectl get all (see all objects)

When a pod is created, a deployment controller is also created, then replicaSet controller is also created. Deployment controller manages replicaSet controller, replicaSet manages pods.

Kubectl delete deployment my-nginx (similar to remove(rm) in docker, it deletes deployment controller, replicaSet controller and dops)

Scaling ReplicaSets
Kubectl scale deploy/my-apache --replicas 2
Kubectl scale deployment my-apache --replicas 2
Above two commands are same, in K8S, deploy=deployment=deployments

Kubectl get pods
Kubectl logs deployment/my-apache --follow --tail 1 (get container logs, return last line only)
Kubectl describe pod/my-apache-xx-xxx (use selector, based on the label containers shared. Get a bunch of details about an object, including events, labels are given when cubectl run xxx, similar to inspect in docker/swarm, in the end of output, can see all the event details)
Kubectl get pods –w (like watch command)
Kubectl delete pod/my-apache-xxx-xxx (delete a pod)
