## **Linux(Bash)**

Passing Variables to Scripts at the Command Line
In the script:  
Using `$1 $2` to refer to the variables that passed at command line  
Exp:

```
$abc.sh “Liang” “Chen”
```

(command line)

```
echo “First name is $1 second name is \$2”
```

(in script) -> return First name is Liang second name is Chen

### If/Then/Else

To check if a file exist: `-a`  
Exp:

```
If [ -a “mytxt.txt” ]; then
```

```
If [ condition ];
Then
#commands to be run if true
elif [ condition ];
then
#commands to be run if true
else
#commands to be run if true
fi
```

### For loop

```
For arg in [List]
Do
#commands
Done
```

```
For ((expression1; expression2; expression3)) do
#commands
Done
Exp:
For ((i=1;i<=100;i++)) do
Echo \$i
Done
```

### While loop

```
While [ condition ] do
#commands
Done
```

### Case statement (same as switch in C#)

```
Case “\$VAR” in
Pattern_1 )
#commands
;; (;;means break)
Pattern_2 )
#commands
;; \* )
#default statement
;;
esac
```

## **Docker-Kubernetes**

Creates a service for existing pods

```
Kubectl expose
```

A **service** is a stable address for pod(s)  
Use **service** to connect pod(s)  
**CoreDNS** allows us to resolve services by name  
Service types:  
ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternName  
**ClusterIP** (Default):  
 Single, internal virtual IP allocated  
 Only reachable from within cluster (nodes and pods)  
 Pods can reach service on apps port number  
**NodePort**:  
High port allocated on each node  
Port is open on every node’s IP  
Anyone can connect (if they can reach node)  
ClusterIP and NodePort are always available in K8S  
**LoadBalancer**:  
Mostly used in Cloud  
Controls a LB endpoint external to the cluster  
Only available when infrastructure provider gives you a LB (AWS ELB…)  
Creates NodePorts + ClusterIP services, tells LB to send to NodePort, only for traffic coming in from external sources  
**ExternalName**:  
Adds CNAME DNS record to CoreDNS only  
Not used for Pods, but for giving pods a DNS name to use for something outside K8S

#### Create ClusterIP & NodePort Service

```
kubectl create deployment httpenv --image=bretfisher/httpenv
kubectl expose deployment/httpenv --port 8888 (open port 8888 for deployment httpenv)
kubectl expose deployment --port 8888 --name httpenv-np --type NodePort httpenv (NodePort, if no –type -> default is ClusterIP)
```

NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE  
service/httpenv ClusterIP 10.96.30.81 <none> 8888/TCP 4m44s
service/httpenv-np NodePort 10.102.76.156 <none> 8888:31351/TCP 27s

httpenv-np’s port: 8888:31351 (8888 is inside the cluster, 31351 is on node expose to outside, range between 30000-32767)

#### Create LoadBalancer

```
kubectl expose deployment --port 8888 --name httpenv-lb --type LoadBalancer httpenv
```

#### DNS in K8S

kubectl get namespaces
NAME STATUS AGE
default Active 22h
docker Active 22h
kube-node-lease Active 22h
kube-public Active 22h
kube-system Active 22h

#### Generators

Commands use helper templates called “generators”

```
kubectl create deployment test --image nginx --dry-run -o yaml
```

(output the result of the command to a yaml file without making any actual change.)

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
creationTimestamp: null
labels:
app: test
name: test
spec:
replicas: 1
selector:
matchLabels:
app: test
strategy: {}
template:
metadata:
creationTimestamp: null
labels:
app: test
spec:
containers: - image: nginx
name: nginx
resources: {}
status: {}
```

> what’s the difference between K8S client version and server version?
> I have upgraded my client version to 1.17.0, but my server version is still 1.14.8.
> Follow link below, only upgraded client version. (already posted my question on Udemy, waiting for answer) https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-on-macos  
> Bret replied:  
> **Client**: the cli binary you are running commands on  
> **Server**: the API service running on the node  
> How you control their versions depends on how you installed them and where they are running.

#### Imperative VS Declarative

**Imperative**:  
Focus on how a program operates (do things step by step)  
**Declarative**:  
Focus on what a program should accomplish (system take care of the process)

Imperative command in K8S:
`Kubectl run, kuberctl create deployment, kubectl update`

Declarative:
`Kubectl apply –f my-resources.yaml Automation, need to understand YAML keys and values`

#### Three management approaches:

1. Imperative commands: run, expose, scale, edit, create deployment…
   Best for dev/learning/personal projects
   Easy to learn, hardest to manager over time
2. Imperative objects (middle ground): create –f files.yml, replace –f file.yml, delete…
   Good for prod of small environments, single file per command
   Store your changes in git-based yaml files
   Hard to automation
3. Declarative objects: apply –f file.yml, dir\, diff…
   Best for prod, easier to automate
   Harder to understand and predict changes

> In the video, it states that serverless will play a big role in 2020, I’m agreed with that, therefore, need to start doing AWS lambda studying.
