## Problem:

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

### Example 1:

```
Input: [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
```

### Solution:

#### Python

```
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        return self._findMin(nums, 0, len(nums) -1)
    def _findMin(self, nums, l, r):
        #when nums has only 1 or 2 elements
        if (l+1 >= r): return min(nums[l],nums[r])

        #sorted
        if(nums[l] < nums[r]): return nums[l]

        m = l + (r -l) // 2

        return min(self._findMin(nums, l, m),
                  self._findMin(nums, m+1, r))
```
