## Problem:

Balanced strings are those who have equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.

Given a balanced string s split it in the maximum amount of balanced strings.

Return the maximum amount of splitted balanced strings.

### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
```

### Solution:

#### Python

```
class Solution:
    def balancedStringSplit(self, s: str) -> int:
        count = res = 0
        for i in s:
            if i == "L":
                count += 1
            else:
                count -= 1
            if count == 0:
                res += 1
        return res
```
