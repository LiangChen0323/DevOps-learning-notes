## Problem:

Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

### Example 1:

```
Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
```

### Solution:

#### Python

```
Keep tracking the prefix sums and their counts.

s -> count: how many arrays nums[0:j] (j < i) that has sum of s

cur_sum = sum(nums[0:i])

check how many arrays nums[0:j] (j < i) that has sum (cur_sum â€“ k)

then there are the same number of arrays nums[j+1: i] that have sum k.

class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 0: return 0
        counts = collections.Counter()
        counts[0] = 1
        cur_sum = 0
        ans = 0
        for num in nums:
            cur_sum += num
            ans += counts[cur_sum -k]
            counts[cur_sum] += 1

        print(counts)
        return ans
```
