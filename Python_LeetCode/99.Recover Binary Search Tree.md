## Problem:

Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

Recover the tree without changing its structure.

### Example 1:

```
Input: [1,3,null,null,2]

   1
  /
 3
  \
   2

Output: [3,1,null,null,2]

   3
  /
 1
  \
   2
```

### Solution:

#### Python

```
Time complexity: O(1) best case, o(N) worst case
Space complexity: O(H), H = tree hight
class Solution:
    def recoverTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify root in-place instead.
        """
        def find_two_swapped(root):
            nonlocal x, y, prev
            if root is None: return
            
            find_two_swapped(root.left)
            if prev and root.val < prev.val:
                x = root
                if y == None: y = prev
            prev = root
            find_two_swapped(root.right)
        
        x = y = prev = None
        find_two_swapped(root)
        x.val, y.val = y.val, x.val
```
