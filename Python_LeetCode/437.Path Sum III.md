## Problem:

You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

### Example 1:

```
root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8

      10
     /  \
    5   -3
   / \    \
  3   2   11
 / \   \
3  -2   1

Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11
```

### Solution 1:

#### Python

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def pathSum(self, root, sum):
        if not root: return 0

        return self.find_paths(root, sum) + self.pathSum(root.left, sum) + self.pathSum(root.right, sum)

    def find_paths(self, root, target):
        if not root:return 0

        return int(root.val == target) + self.find_paths(root.left, target-root.val) + self.find_paths(root.right, target-root.val)
```
