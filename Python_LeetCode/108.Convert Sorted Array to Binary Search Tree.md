## Problem:

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

### Example 1:

```
Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

### Solution:

#### Python

```
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(logn)
class Solution:
    def sortedArrayToBST(self, nums: List[int]) -> TreeNode:
        def buildBST(l, r):
            if l > r: return None
            m = l + (r-l) // 2
            root = TreeNode(nums[m])
            root.left = buildBST(l, m-1)
            root.right= buildBST(m+1, r)
            return root
        
        return buildBST(0,len(nums)-1)
        
```
