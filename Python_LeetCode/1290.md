## Problem:

Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

### Example 1:

```
nput: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10
```

### Solution:

#### Python

```
Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
def init (self, x):
self.val = x
self.next = None
```

Solution:

```
def getDecimalValue(self, head: ListNode) -> int:
res=0
while head:
res=res\*2+head.val
head=head.next
return res
```
