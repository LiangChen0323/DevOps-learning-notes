## Problem:

Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.

### Example 1:

```
Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".

```

### Example 2:

```
Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "".

```

### Example 3:

```
Input: S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "c".

```

### Example 4:

```
Input: S = "a#c", T = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: S becomes "c" while T becomes "b".
```

### Solution:

#### Python

```
class Solution:
    def backspaceCompare(self, S: str, T: str) -> bool:
        def build(S):
            ans = []
            for c in S:
                if c != "#":
                    ans.append(c)
                elif ans:
                    ans.pop()
            return "".join(ans)
        return build(S) == build(T)
```
