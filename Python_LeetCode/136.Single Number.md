## Problem:

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

### Example 1:

```
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

### Solution:

#### Python

```
class Solution 2:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return sum(set(nums))*2 - sum(nums)
```

```
If we take XOR of zero and some bit, it will return that bit
a ⊕ 0 = a

If we take XOR of two same bits, it will return 0
a ⊕ a = 0

a⊕b⊕a=(a⊕a)⊕b=0⊕b=b

class Solution 2:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        a = 0
        for i in nums:
            a ^= i
        return a
```
