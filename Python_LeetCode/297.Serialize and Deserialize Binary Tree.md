## Problem:

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

### Example 1:

```
You may serialize the following tree:

    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5

as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
```

### Solution 1:

#### Python

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Codec:

    def serialize(self, root):
        """Encodes a tree to a single string.

        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: str
        """
        def _serialize(node):
            if not node:
                data.append('#')
            else:
                data.append(str(node.val))
                _serialize(node.left)
                _serialize(node.right)

        data = []
        _serialize(root)
        return ','.join(data)

    def deserialize(self, data):
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree.

        :type data: str
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        def _deserialize(q):
            val = q.popleft()
            if val == '#':
                return None
            node = TreeNode(int(val))
            node.left = _deserialize(q)
            node.right = _deserialize(q)
            return node

        q = deque(data.split(','))
        return _deserialize(q)

# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
# codec = Codec()
# codec.deserialize(codec.serialize(root))
```
